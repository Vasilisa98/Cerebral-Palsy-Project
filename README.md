# Cerebral-Palsy-Project

This repository contains all of the step-by-step analyses, simulation inputs, and plots generated for the dissertation on musculoskeletal modeling in children with cerebral palsy.

### code/  
- **step_by_step_analysis.ipynb**  
  Contains the full, annotated Jupyter notebook that walks through every analysis step for the dissertation: from data import, filtering, running OpenSim, through to CEINMS calibration and execution, and plotting the results.  


### Simulation/  
- One folder per participant: six TD subjects  using the **right leg** for simulations, four CP subjects with **right leg** except **PC006** (left leg).  
- **Inside each subject folder** youâ€™ll find:
  - All necessary input files (.c3d file, force-plate data, OpenSim files).  
  - A **ceinms/** subfolder containing the CEINMS setup (EMG mappings, calibration settings, execution scripts).  

- **Plots_for_thesis/** (within each subject):  
  - **All_Activations_plots/** 
  - **All_Moments_plots/**
